# OpenChoreo Concepts

OpenChoreo is an open-source Internal Developer Platform (IDP) built on Kubernetes. Both developers and platform engineers interact primarily through the control-plane MCP server (`openchoreo-cp`). For build logs, longer-horizon log history, metrics, traces, alerts, or incidents, platform engineers drop to `kubectl logs` against the appropriate plane (workflow plane for Argo build pods, observability plane for fluent-bit / OpenSearch / observer). Platform engineers also fall back to `kubectl` for resources without an MCP write surface and for plane-internal CRDs and controller logs; developers stay in MCP and don't need direct cluster access.

## Core Abstractions

### Project

A bounded context grouping related components. At runtime, each Project × Environment becomes a **Cell** with its own isolated data-plane namespace, network policies, and security controls.

**Key fields**:

- `deploymentPipelineRef`: promotion path (object, not a plain string — see below)
- `type`: the `(Cluster)ProjectType` that defines the cell's infrastructure — **required and immutable** (`{kind, name}`; `kind` defaults to `ProjectType`). A project cannot be re-targeted to a different type after creation.
- `parameters`: values validated against the type's `parameters` schema, inlined into each ProjectRelease.

The project follows the same release chain as components and resources — `Project + ProjectType → ProjectRelease → ProjectReleaseBinding → cell on the data plane`. The **ProjectReleaseBinding owns the cell namespace** for each environment; component and resource deployments to an environment wait for it to converge first. See **ProjectType** below and [`project-types.md`](./project-types.md).

Components within a project communicate freely. Cross-project reachability is governed by endpoint visibility (see below).

**Example**: An e-commerce app might have "order-management" (order-service, payment-handler) and "user-management" (auth-service, profile-service) as separate projects.

### Component

A deployable unit. References a ComponentType that defines how it's deployed. Think of ComponentType as the blueprint and Component as a specific house built from it.

**Key fields**:

- `componentType`: Reference like `deployment/service` (format: `workloadType/typeName`)
- `owner.projectName`: Which project this belongs to
- `parameters`: Config values matching the ComponentType schema
- `traits`: Optional composable capabilities
- `autoDeploy`: When true, automatically creates releases when Workload changes
- `workflow`: Build configuration for source-to-image on current Component resources

**Example**: Each microservice, web frontend, or background job is a separate component.

### Workload

The runtime contract. Defines what image to run, what ports to expose, and what services to connect to.

**How it gets created**:

- **BYO image** (Component has no `spec.workflow`): the developer creates it explicitly via `create_workload`.
- **Source build** (Component has `spec.workflow`): the build's `generate-workload` step **auto-generates it**. The workload is always named `{component}-workload` — the build overrides any `metadata.name` from the descriptor. The build inlines `workload.yaml` from the source repo if present; otherwise the workload contains only the container image.

**Key fields**:

- `container`: image, command, args, env vars, files
- `endpoints`: Map of named network interfaces with type (`HTTP`, `GraphQL`, `Websocket`, `gRPC`, `TCP`, `UDP`) and visibility
- `dependencies.endpoints[]`: Connections to other components' endpoints, with automatic env var injection (renamed from `connections` in v1.0.0; nested under `dependencies.endpoints`, not flat at `dependencies`)

### Workload Descriptor

A `workload.yaml` file placed in your source repository — **the developer's source of truth** for the source-build component's runtime contract: endpoints, dependencies, env vars, file mounts, schemas. Hand-maintained, not auto-generated.

The build's `generate-workload` step reads `workload.yaml` and emits a Workload CR (image + descriptor). Without `workload.yaml`, the auto-generated Workload contains only the image and has no routing. (This step runs inside the build pipeline — neither developers nor PEs invoke it directly.)

**Placement**: Must be at the root of the `appPath` directory. If `appPath` is `/backend`, place it at `/backend/workload.yaml`. Not the docker context root, not the repo root (unless `appPath` is `.`).

**Preferred enrichment path**: edit `workload.yaml` in the repo, commit, rebuild. The new workload spec flows through the build. Reach for `update_workload` MCP only when rebuilding isn't possible.

For the full descriptor schema and source-build flow, see `openchoreo-developer/references/recipes/build-from-source.md`.

### Endpoint Visibility

Controls who can reach your service:

- `project`: Same project and environment (implicit for all endpoints)
- `namespace`: All projects in the same OpenChoreo namespace and environment
- `internal`: All OpenChoreo namespaces in the deployment
- `external`: Public internet — exposed through the platform's ingress gateway

"Namespace" here is the OpenChoreo (control-plane) namespace that holds the Project/Component resources — not a shared runtime namespace. Each Project runs in its own isolated Cell namespace at runtime; a cross-project `namespace`-visibility call still resolves because the platform routes it to the target's Cell.

`project` and `namespace` reachability is resolved by the platform within the data plane: a cross-project call at `namespace` visibility gets the target's in-cluster address injected, with no extra gateway setup. `external` is exposed through the platform's ingress gateway, which a standard install usually configures. If an exposed endpoint doesn't resolve, check the DataPlane's gateway configuration rather than assuming the visibility is blocked.

### ProjectType

Platform-engineer-defined template for a project's **cell infrastructure** — the data-plane namespace every project runs in plus the namespace-scoped policy around it (NetworkPolicies, ResourceQuotas, baseline RBAC, image-pull secrets). A Project references one via `spec.type`. Like ResourceType, it carries `parameters` / `environmentConfigs` schemas, CEL `validations`, and a `resources[]` list — which **must** declare the cell namespace itself (a `v1/Namespace` with `metadata.name: ${metadata.namespace}`, else `NamespaceMissing`). A `default` ClusterProjectType ships (namespace only); UI / API / `occ project scaffold` default to it, but `kubectl`-applied Projects must set `spec.type`. Scope-collapsed MCP tools + full authoring → [`project-types.md`](./project-types.md).

### ComponentType

Platform-engineer-defined template that controls how a component deploys. Developers pick from available types and fill in the schema. View available types with `list_component_types` and inspect one with `get_component_type` / `get_component_type_schema` — all take a `scope` arg (`"cluster"` for the platform-wide ClusterComponentTypes most installs use, `"namespace"` for namespace-local ones). Authoring goes through MCP (`create_component_type` + `update_component_type`, same `scope` arg) or `kubectl apply -f` for big YAML edits — see `component-types-and-traits.md`.

**Workload types**: `deployment`, `statefulset`, `cronjob`, `job`, `proxy`

**Two kinds of parameters**:

- `parameters`: Static config, same everywhere the release deploys (e.g., image pull policy)
- `envOverrides`: The per-environment part of the ComponentType schema

ReleaseBinding supplies the actual per-environment values for that schema under `componentTypeEnvironmentConfigs`.

### Trait

Composable capability attached to components. Adds resources (like PVCs) or modifies existing ones (inject env vars, add volumes) without changing the ComponentType.

Each trait instance on a component needs a unique `instanceName`. This lets you attach the same trait type multiple times with different configs (e.g., two different persistent volumes).

View available traits: `list_traits` (`scope: "cluster"` for platform-wide ClusterTraits, `scope: "namespace"` for namespace-local ones). Inspect: `get_trait` / `get_trait_schema`, same `scope` arg.

**Common traits**: persistent-volume, ingress, autoscaling, resource-limits.

### Environment

A deployment target (dev, staging, prod). Maps to a DataPlane (Kubernetes cluster). View with `list_environments`. Create / update via `create_environment` / `update_environment` (note: `data_plane_ref` is immutable after creation).

### DeploymentPipeline

Defines promotion paths between environments. A pipeline might be: development → staging → production.

**Important**: `deploymentPipelineRef` in Project spec is an **object** (changed in v1.0.0 — previously a plain string). `kind` is optional and defaults to `DeploymentPipeline`:

```yaml
# Both of these are valid
deploymentPipelineRef:
  name: default

deploymentPipelineRef:
  kind: DeploymentPipeline
  name: default

# Wrong - plain string no longer accepted
deploymentPipelineRef: default
```

### ComponentRelease

Immutable snapshot of Component + Workload + ComponentType + Traits at a point in time. Like a lock file for deployments. Created automatically when `autoDeploy: true`, or manually with `create_component_release`. Discoverable via `list_component_releases`.

### ReleaseBinding

Binds a ComponentRelease to an Environment. This is what triggers actual deployment. Supports environment-specific overrides:

- `componentTypeEnvironmentConfigs`: Replicas, resource limits, etc.
- `traitEnvironmentConfigs`: Per-environment trait values keyed by trait `instanceName` (renamed from `traitOverrides` in v1.0.0).
- `workloadOverrides`: Extra env vars, files for specific environments
- `state`: `Active` (running) or `Undeploy` (removed)

### Resource

Developer-authored: a managed-infrastructure dependency for a Project (database, queue, cache, object storage). References a `ResourceType` / `ClusterResourceType` the way a Component references a ComponentType. Lives under a Project as a sibling of Component. Shared by every consumer Component in the same Project + Environment.

PEs rarely create Resources directly — they're the dev's handle on infrastructure. PE involvement is on the *template* (ResourceType) and on the per-environment *binding* (ResourceReleaseBinding) — see below.

### ResourceType / ClusterResourceType

The platform-engineering side of resource abstractions. Defines the Kubernetes manifests that get rendered to a data plane when a Resource is deployed — for example, a postgres `ResourceType` might emit a `StatefulSet` + `Service` + ESO-generated `ExternalSecret` with the credentials. Mirrors ComponentType in scope (`Cluster*` and namespace-scoped variants, interchangeable by swapping `kind:` + `metadata.namespace:`).

**Key shape**:

- `spec.parameters.openAPIV3Schema` — the dev-facing knobs (instance size, storage size, database name…).
- `spec.environmentConfigs.openAPIV3Schema` — the per-env knobs (replica count, admin-tools-enabled, …). Mirrors ComponentType's `environmentConfigs`.
- `spec.resources[]` — list of named manifest entries with optional `includeWhen` / `readyWhen` CEL expressions. Each entry has an `id`; outputs and per-entry readiness reference entries by id.
- `spec.outputs[]` — named values that consuming components read via `Workload.spec.dependencies.resources[].envBindings` / `.fileBindings`. Output kinds: literal `value`, `secretKeyRef`, or `configMapKeyRef`.
- `spec.retainPolicy` — `Delete` (default) or `Retain`. PE default for whether deleting a binding cascades the data-plane resource. Per-env override lives on `ResourceReleaseBinding.spec.retainPolicy`.

Author with `create_resource_type` / `update_resource_type` (both take `scope: "cluster"` for `ClusterResourceType`). For CEL surface, output shapes, and a worked authoring walkthrough see `./resource-types.md`. Most installs ship `postgres`, `valkey`, and `nats` as `ClusterResourceType`s in `samples/getting-started/cluster-resource-types/` — useful as reference templates.

**Cross-scope rule**: a `ClusterResourceType` may only emit cluster-scoped manifests or namespace-scoped manifests that pick their target namespace from `${metadata.namespace}` (the binding's project-env namespace). Namespace-scoped `ResourceType` is also free to target the binding namespace this way. Pick the scope based on whether the template needs to be platform-wide.

### ResourceRelease

Immutable snapshot of `{Resource, ResourceType}` at a point in time, named `{resource}-{hash}`. The Resource controller cuts a new release automatically whenever `Resource.spec` or the referenced template's spec changes — so a PE edit to a `ResourceType` cuts a release on every consuming Resource. Bindings stay pinned to the old release until explicitly promoted; an edit to a popular template doesn't fan redeploys across every env automatically.

### ResourceReleaseBinding

Binds a ResourceRelease to an Environment — the deploy-here resource for infrastructure. One binding per Resource per environment. The Resource controller never fans these out automatically; each binding is authored explicitly via `create_resource_release_binding`, the Backstage UI's Deploy action, or a GitOps commit. In practice PE / GitOps owns the lifecycle, but the surface is open to dev.

**Key fields**:

- `spec.resourceRelease`: which `ResourceRelease` is pinned to this env. The promote knob.
- `spec.environment`: target env (immutable after creation).
- `spec.owner: { projectName, resourceName }`: parent Project + Resource (immutable).
- `spec.resourceTypeEnvironmentConfigs`: per-env values matching the ResourceType's `environmentConfigs` schema.
- `spec.retainPolicy`: `Delete` / `Retain`. Overrides the snapshot's `ResourceType.spec.retainPolicy`. Common pattern: set `Retain` on prod for stateful infra.

**Status**: `Synced`, `ResourcesReady`, `OutputsResolved`, `Ready` (aggregate), `Finalizing`. `status.outputs[]` is the single source of truth for resolved outputs — consuming components read this via the workload renderer's `dependencies.resources[]` resolver. Secret values stay on the data plane; only `{name, key}` references travel through the control plane.

**Promote** = update `spec.resourceRelease` to a newer `ResourceRelease` name. `occ resource promote --env <env> <resource>` is a thin two-call wrapper (read `Resource.status.latestRelease.name`, then PUT the binding).

### Workflow / WorkflowRun

Workflow is a build template defined by platform engineers (backed by Argo Workflows). WorkflowRun is an execution. Component workflows build container images from source; standalone workflows handle automation like migrations.

**How CI builds work**: When you trigger a build (`trigger_workflow_run` for component-bound, `create_workflow_run` for standalone), the workflow clones the repo, builds the image, then emits a Workload CR from `workload.yaml`. The controller picks this up and creates / updates the Workload resource. If `autoDeploy` is on, this triggers a new release and deployment. See `openchoreo-developer/references/recipes/build-from-source.md` for the full pipeline flow.

**Why workload.yaml exists**: A Dockerfile only describes how to build an image. It doesn't tell the platform what ports your app listens on, what protocol it speaks, or what other services it connects to. The `workload.yaml` descriptor fills this gap, declaring your app's runtime contract so the platform can generate the right routing, network policies, and service discovery.

### SecretReference

Points to secrets stored in an external secret store (like OpenBao or HashiCorp Vault). The platform syncs them into Kubernetes Secrets via External Secrets Operator. Workloads consume them via `valueFrom.secretKeyRef` — `container.env[].valueFrom.secretKeyRef` for environment variables, `container.files[].valueFrom.secretKeyRef` for file mounts.

## Cell Architecture (Runtime)

At runtime, each Project becomes a Cell. Components within a Cell communicate freely; reachability beyond the Cell is governed by endpoint `visibility`:

- `external` is exposed to the public internet through the platform's ingress gateway.
- `namespace` / `internal` make an endpoint reachable to other projects; the platform resolves these to in-cluster addresses.

Endpoint `visibility` on the Workload selects this. The ingress gateway and network-policy provider are configured on the DataPlane; what a given install supports is verifiable there.

## Deployment Flow

```text
Component → Workload → ComponentRelease → ReleaseBinding         → RenderedRelease (on DataPlane)
Resource             → ResourceRelease  → ResourceReleaseBinding → RenderedRelease (on DataPlane)
```

Component side:

1. Define Component (what to deploy, which type)
2. Define Workload (image, ports, dependencies) — manually or via build
3. ComponentRelease is created (immutable snapshot)
4. ReleaseBinding deploys release to environment
5. Platform renders templates, creates Kubernetes resources

For `autoDeploy: true` components, steps 3–4 happen automatically when the Workload changes.

Resource side (mirrors the component flow without the Workload step):

1. Developer defines Resource (which infra, which ResourceType, what parameters)
2. Resource controller auto-cuts a `ResourceRelease` whenever `Resource.spec` or the referenced `ResourceType.spec` changes
3. PE / GitOps authors one `ResourceReleaseBinding` per environment; promote by updating `spec.resourceRelease`
4. Platform renders the templates the ResourceType declares, creates Kubernetes resources on the data plane
5. Resolved outputs surface on `ResourceReleaseBinding.status.outputs[]`; consuming Components pick them up via `Workload.spec.dependencies.resources[]`

## Infrastructure Planes

These are platform-engineer managed. Developers see them as read-only.

- **Control Plane**: Runs OpenChoreo controllers and API server.
- **Data Plane**: Runs application workloads (can be multiple clusters).
- **WorkflowPlane**: Runs CI/CD builds (Argo Workflows; formerly called Build Plane).
- **Observability Plane**: Centralized logging (OpenSearch + Fluentbit).

## API Version

All OpenChoreo resources use: `apiVersion: openchoreo.dev/v1alpha1`.

## Inter-service Communication

Services within the same project can talk freely. For cross-project communication or formalized connections, use the Workload `dependencies` field instead of hardcoding URLs. The platform resolves service addresses and injects them as environment variables.

```yaml
dependencies:
  endpoints:
    - component: backend-api
      name: api                       # name of the target endpoint
      visibility: project
      envBindings:
        address: BACKEND_URL
```

This injects `BACKEND_URL` with the resolved address. No hardcoded hostnames, no guessing service DNS names. Note that connections live under `dependencies.endpoints[]`, not directly under `dependencies[]`.

## Resource Dependencies

Components consume managed infrastructure (databases, queues, caches) by referencing a Project-scoped `Resource` from `Workload.spec.dependencies.resources[]`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  resources:
    - ref: orders-db                          # name of a Resource in the same Project
      envBindings:
        host: DB_HOST                         # ResourceType output → container env var
        password: DB_PASSWORD
      fileBindings:
        ca-cert: /etc/ssl/db-ca.pem           # secretKeyRef / configMapKeyRef outputs only
```

The renderer looks up the consumer environment's `ResourceReleaseBinding.status.outputs[]`, dispatches per output kind, and threads env vars + volumes into the rendered Pod via the existing `dependencies.envVars` / `dependencies.volumes` / `dependencies.volumeMounts` lists. A `${configurations.toContainerVolumeMounts() + dependencies.toContainerVolumeMounts()}` shape on a ComponentType template merges resource-side and configurations-side mounts in one pass.

If a referenced Resource has no Ready binding in the consumer's environment, the consumer's `ReleaseBinding` flips to `ResourceDependenciesReady=False, Reason=ResourceDependenciesPending` with a per-entry breakdown on `status.pendingResourceDependencies[]`. This is the gate developers see when a Resource hasn't been promoted into their env yet.

The `ref` must name a Resource owned by the same Project as the consumer Component. Authority over the binding sits with PE / GitOps; the developer reads `status.outputs` and consumes them.

## Discovery-first workflow (per task)

For any individual platform task, follow these five phases in order. They're encoded as the agent's working style in `SKILL.md` and elaborated here.

### 1. Classify the task

Decide whether the work is:

- Pure platform work (this skill alone)
- App work that needs PE help (paired with `openchoreo-developer`)
- A mixed task that needs both OpenChoreo skills

For mixed tasks, keep the app-facing thread and the platform-facing thread connected. Many deployment failures are caused by an interaction between Component config and platform config.

### 2. Inspect current state via MCP first

Start with the smallest useful inspection:

- `get_component` / `get_workload` / `get_release_binding` for app-facing resources (status conditions, endpoints).
- `get_component_type` / `get_trait` / `get_workflow` (with `scope: "cluster"`) for platform extensions.
- `list_environments`, `list_deployment_pipelines`, plane reads (`list_dataplanes`, `get_dataplane`, etc.) for topology.
- `get_resource_events` / `get_resource_logs` for pod-level debugging through a binding.

Drop to `kubectl logs` only when MCP can't reach what you need — controller pods, cluster-gateway, cluster-agent, or pods outside any OpenChoreo binding.

### 3. Fetch creation / resource schemas before authoring

Before writing a `spec` body for a `create_*` call, fetch the relevant schema:

- `get_component_type_creation_schema`, `get_trait_creation_schema`, `get_workflow_creation_schema` — each takes a `scope` arg (`"cluster"` for the `Cluster*` variant)
- `get_workload_schema`; `get_component_type_schema`, `get_trait_schema`, `get_workflow_schema` (with `scope`) for inspecting existing-resource shape

For existing resources, read the current spec via `get_*` before sending an `update_*`. **`update_component_type`, `update_trait`, `update_workflow` are full-spec replacement** (at either `scope`) — read first, modify locally, send the complete spec back. Omitting a field deletes it. For one-line CEL or template tweaks, `kubectl apply -f` against an edited YAML is often easier; both paths produce the same end state.

### 4. Change one layer at a time

Platform tasks often span multiple layers:

- Helm install values
- Control-plane CRDs (Environment, DeploymentPipeline, ComponentType, etc.)
- Remote-plane resources (data-plane Gateway, ESO ClusterSecretStore, Argo ClusterWorkflowTemplate)
- App-visible outcomes (available types, workflows, route reachability)

Change the layer that is actually responsible, then re-check the dependent layers. Don't "fix" an application symptom by guessing at platform internals.

### 5. Verify with live evidence

Verification should come from the platform, not assumption:

- Resource conditions changed as expected (`get_*` → `status.conditions[]`).
- Controller / agent logs show the new state (`kubectl logs` against the relevant plane).
- Helm release and pod rollout are healthy.
- The downstream app-facing symptom is gone.

If the platform change succeeded but the app still fails, hand off to or continue with `openchoreo-developer`.
