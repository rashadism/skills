# OpenChoreo on K3d Locally

Bootstrap OpenChoreo on a local k3d cluster. The k3d guide is fully opinionated, so this playbook is mostly straight execution.

> **Disclaimer:** the fetched install guide is the source of truth. If anything here conflicts with the guide, follow the guide.

## Step 1 — Capture choices

Apply silent defaults unless the user opted out. Summarise resolved choices before running anything.

| Decision | Options | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OpenChoreo version** | latest stable / specific minor / bleeding edge (`next`) | latest stable (the fetch script resolves it and prints on stderr) |
| **Optional planes** | Workflow, Observability | install both; skip one only if the user opted out (control + data planes always install) |
| **Default platform resources** | yes / no | yes; skip only if the user opted out (without these no apps can deploy) |
| **Modules** | only honour what the user explicitly asked for | none. Install the defaults (OpenSearch logs + tracing, Prometheus metrics, OTEL collector for events, kgateway). If the user named a plane but no module, install that plane's default module. Don't prompt or suggest alternatives. If the user named a module (e.g. "use OpenObserve for logs", "swap kgateway for Traefik"), apply it per Step 3 and load its README. Catalogue: <https://openchoreo.dev/ecosystem/modules.md>. |

The guide's "Try it out" sections (deploy a sample, build from source) are opt-in. Walk past them during install; offer them after.

## Step 2 — Fetch the install guide

Run from the skill root:

```bash
./scripts/fetch-page.sh --title "Run Locally on K3d"
./scripts/fetch-page.sh --title "Run Locally on K3d" --version v1.0.x   # pin a minor
./scripts/fetch-page.sh --title "Run Locally on K3d" --version next     # bleeding edge
```

If the script exits non-zero, it has printed the version's `llms.txt`; pick the right URL and fetch it directly.

## Step 3 — Walk the guide

Top-to-bottom in the user's shell. Rules:

- **Skip plane sections the user opted out of** (the workflow plane is sometimes called "Build Plane").
- **Apply module overrides only if the user asked for one** (Step 1). The defaults here are OpenSearch (logs + tracing), Prometheus (metrics), the OTEL collector for events and kgateway. They need no README. For each requested non-default module, skip the default's install and load its README at `https://github.com/openchoreo/community-modules/tree/main/<module-name>`. If the README and the guide disagree on that slot, follow the README and note it under Deviations. Logs/tracing/metrics: the obs-plane core still installs from the guide; only the per-signal `helm install` is replaced. Data-plane gateway: keep the kgateway install in the guide (CP and observability gateways still need it in single-cluster), then follow the alt gateway README to replace the data-plane `gateway-default` and upgrade the data-plane chart with `gatewayClassName=<x>`.
- **Check the platform-specific tweaks below** before starting.
- **On failure, use judgment.** You have the cluster — `kubectl describe / logs / get events`, condition checks. If the cause is clear and the fix is in scope, fix it and continue; otherwise surface and ask. Don't silently substitute "equivalent" commands and don't strip `kubectl wait` calls. Keep a running note of any fix or deviation for the report.

## Step 3.5 — Verify before reporting

- [ ] All OpenChoreo deployments Available: `kubectl get deploy -A | awk 'NR>1 && $4!=$5'` should return zero rows for `openchoreo-*` / `thunder` / `openbao` namespaces.
- [ ] Console URL returns 200 (from the guide's "Log in" step): `curl -sI http://openchoreo.localhost:8080 | head -1`.
- [ ] API health: `curl -sf http://api.openchoreo.localhost:8080/health`.
- [ ] Thunder readiness: `curl -sf http://thunder.openchoreo.localhost:8080/health/readiness`.
- [ ] If OP installed: Observer health: `curl -sf http://observer.openchoreo.localhost:11080/health`.
- [ ] If OP installed: the logs module's collection DaemonSet (e.g. fluent-bit) is Ready in `openchoreo-observability-plane` (labels per the module's chart).
- [ ] If the user asked for a non-default module: its README was loaded and followed.
- [ ] If WP installed: `kubectl get clusterworkflowtemplates` shows the checkout / build / publish / generate-workload templates.

Anything red → surface in the report's "Deviations" or "Outcome: partial".

## Step 4 — Report

Summarise what happened. Drop categories that don't apply.

- **Outcome** — success / partial (where did you stop?) / failed.
- **Version installed** and which planes are up and registered.
- **Choices applied**: opted-out planes, whether default platform resources were installed, any module overrides (e.g. OpenObserve logs, Traefik data-plane gateway), and the README followed for each.
- **Workarounds applied** — anything that wasn't a straight read of the guide, and why.
- **Deviations from the guide** — commands not run as written, extra steps added during diagnose-and-fix.
- **Console URL and login**, copied from the guide.
- **Follow-ups** — opt-in "Try it out" sections, any day-2 platform work.

## Cleanup

`k3d cluster delete openchoreo`.

## Platform-specific tweaks

Things to watch for on specific runtimes.

### Apple Silicon — recommend Colima

Docker Desktop on M-series has buildpack issues. Suggest `colima start --vm-type=vz --vz-rosetta --cpu 4 --memory 8`. If their existing Docker works, don't push.

When using Colima, also `export K3D_FIX_DNS=0` before `k3d cluster create` — the guide mentions this in a `:::note` above the create command but it's easy to skim past.
